## Overview 📖
Reactive Burger is an app that allows you to create a profile, build the burger you like, order it, and enjoy it 🍔 👅 (hypothetically, of course). The app was built using `React` and its entire ecosystem (Redux, redux-thunk, react-router, etc.), and also takes full advantage of the `Firebase` platform.
